# OpenLiga DB Team Winning Notification
<!-- section: Introduction -->
<!-- Describe briefly what your software is. What problem does it solve? At what target audience is it aimed? -->

This is a lambda function that sends you an email when you favorite club has won in the last week. This is especially useful, when you are currently disappointed by your team and only want to hear from them if the won (like me at the moment). It uses [OpenLigaDB](https://www.openligadb.de/) as API. See the website for relevant IDs in your .env file

The following environment data is required:

| Name        | Description                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COMPETITION | Identifier for competition to get (i.e. `bl1` for Bundesliga)   |
| SEASON      | Identifier for season to get (i.e. `2021` for season 2ÃŸ21/2022) |
| TEAMID      | Identifier for team to get (i.e. `7` for Borussia Dortmund)     |
| RECIPIENT   | Recipient email adress to whom the mail is sent                 |
| SOURCE      | Email adress from whom the mail was sent                        |

Run `npm i` and `npm pack:clean` for creating the bundle. Create an AWS Lambda function and apply a role including the SESFullAccess policy. You might want to restrict this. Upload the bundle and override basic configuration (i.e. max execution time) when needed. Set the einvorment data described above with the desired values. Run a test to see whether it is working.

Go to Cloudwatch and create a rule with a cron pattern (e.g. `0 6 ? * MON *` for every monday 6 am UTC) and set your lambda as target. Done!
